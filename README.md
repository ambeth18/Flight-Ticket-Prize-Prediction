1. Introduction

This self-directed project aimed to develop a predictive model for flight ticket prices using machine learning techniques. The project involved exploring a dataset of flight details and applying various machine learning algorithms to forecast ticket prices based on multiple features.

2. Objective

The primary objective was to build and evaluate machine learning models that predict flight ticket prices based on features such as airlines, source and destination, number of stops, date, month, year, departure and arrival times, and flight duration.

3. Methodology

3.1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

An in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed on a dataset containing 10,684 flight records. Key steps included:

Data Inspection: Examined features such as airlines, source and destination airports, total stops, price, date, month, year, departure and arrival times, and flight duration.
Pattern Identification: Identified patterns and insights through statistical summaries and visualizations to understand the relationships between features and flight prices.
3.2. Machine Learning Model Development

Machine learning models were developed using Python in Jupyter Notebook to predict flight ticket prices. The process involved:

Feature Selection: Selected relevant features based on EDA insights to improve model accuracy.
Model Training: Implemented and trained various machine learning algorithms, including regression models, to predict flight ticket prices.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score to ensure accurate predictions.
4. Results

The machine learning models demonstrated the ability to predict flight ticket prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Key results include:

Model Performance: Evaluated model accuracy and performance metrics, identifying the best-performing algorithm for price prediction.
Insights and Patterns: Gained insights into how different features, such as the day of the week and flight duration, impact ticket prices.
5. Conclusion

The project successfully applied machine learning techniques to predict flight ticket prices, utilizing a comprehensive dataset and various algorithms. The predictive models provide valuable insights into pricing patterns and can be useful for applications such as fare forecasting and travel planning.

6. Future Work

Future improvements could involve:

Feature Engineering: Incorporating additional features or refining existing ones to enhance model performance.
